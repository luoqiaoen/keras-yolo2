# YOLOv2 in Keras and Applications

This repo contains the implementation of YOLOv2 in Keras with Tensorflow backend. It supports training YOLOv2 network with various backends such as MobileNet and InceptionV3. 

See original repo for more information.

I am using this forked package to process a large repo of images for kaggle. Many original codes were modified for my particular needs.
